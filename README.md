# hi-lo
Making of Hi-Lo Game in C++ without using loops.


Implement a game of hi-lo. First, your program should pick a random integer between
1 and 100. Your solution should handle invalid guesses (e.g. ‘x’), out of bounds guesses
(e.g. 0 or 101), or valid guesses that have extraneous characters (e.g. 69x). 

The user is given 5 tries to guess the number.

1) If the user does not guess the correct number, the program should tell them whether they guessed
too high or too low. 

2) If the user guesses the right number, the program should tell them they won.

3)If they run out of guesses, the program should tell them they lost, and what the correct number is.
